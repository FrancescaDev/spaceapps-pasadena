/* Color */
// To change your theme's color scheme, replace the existing HEX color values
// with custom HEX color values. Use our color palette generator to help come up
// with pairings and check your color contrast.
// https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#tools-for-picking-colors

// Primary colors ($mdc-theme-primary) map to components such as app bars and
// buttons, while secondary colors ($mdc-theme-secondary) are used as accents on
// components such as FABs and selection controls.

// “On-” colors define how text, icons, and strokes are colored in relation to
// the surface on which they appear. If you are updating these manually, be sure
// to consider accessible color contrast for the value pairs.

// Theme background ($mdc-theme-background) appears behind scrollable content.
// Surface color ($mdc-theme-surface) is mapped to the surface of components
// such as cards, sheets, and menus. Error color ($mdc-theme-error) is used to
// indicate an error state for components such as text fields provided with
// inaccurate input.
